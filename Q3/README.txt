CNN Democratic Debate was held on April 14 in Brooklyn, the last debate before New Yorkâ€™s primary. Since social medias like Twitter and Facebook have been the main ways for individuals to express opinions and engage in politics, tweets and posts related to this debate can provide insights about public attitudes towards these two candidates, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. My project is trying to find out who is Americans cheering for by performing Twitter sentiment analysis.
